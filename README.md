This project aims to create a comprehensive series of articles on strategic decision models on GitHub. It is designed as a living knowledge base that will be updated over time with new additions.

Although I am starting without a strict roadmap, I believe the content will evolve as I write. I aim to classify and explain every decision support model I can find.

Each model will be explained in a consistent format:
* **History:** Who created it, how did it emerge?
* **Problem Definition:** Which questions does it answer?
* **Methodology:** How is it applied? (5W1H)
* **Visuals:** Diagrams and charts.
* **Use Cases:** In which sectors or scenarios is it effective?
